This directory contains code and data for generating SQL to load the standard
HLA genotypes and ambiguity groups into Viroverse's schema (the
`viroserve.hla_genotypes` table).

The Makefile controls all execution and is responsible for downloading the
necessary data files from hla.alleles.org's repository.

The generate-sql script, run by make, reads these files and outputs three SQL
files: a deploy script, a revert script, and a verify script.  These are
designed to be copied into new sqitch changes intended to update Viroverse's
HLA table.  Since HLA types are referred to by several other tables, the output
files are incremental updates to the `hla_genotypes` table based on its current
contents (at the time generate-sql is run).

To support new database bootstrapping, the script also produces a set of
"everything" files which ignores what's the in the current database and
produces SQL that assumes the `hla_genotypes` table is empty.

All of the generated SQL files are excluded from version control since they are
intended only to be intermediate files.  Their contents are intended to be
checked into version control in other places, like sqitch changes.
