# Viroverse

This repository is the public, open-source version of Viroverse, a platform for
the collection, storage, retrieval, and analysis of experimental data for
laboratory workflows.  Learn more about Viroverse at
<https://viroverse.washington.edu>.

Currently Viroverse is in very early pre-release and has many, many rough edges
and approximately no documentation.  If you're interested in trying out
Viroverse yourself, your best bet is to [reach out to us][] so we can engage
one-on-one to help you out.
